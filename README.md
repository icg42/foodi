# Foodi - Fluid UI and Wix.com Project :iphone:

In my Fall 2021 semester, I completed a project in my Business Technology & Innovation (BTE210) course in which I used Fluid UI to create a mobile prototype for an app known as Foodi, which helps users find local restaurants that fit their preferences or are trending in their area. I then used Wix.com to design a website that showcases Foodi's features.
